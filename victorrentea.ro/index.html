<h3>A good training should...</h3>
            <ul class="phylosophy">
                <li><b><span class="high">Incite you</span></b> through a very active style with questions, brainstorms, animations, demos, videos, jokes and contests with prizes</li>
                <li><b>Help you <span class="high">understand the core concepts</span></b>: The driving purpose, the "WHY", the underlying phylosophy</li>
                <li><b><span class="high">Show most of the story</span></b>, with lots of examples and exercises; no dull APIs or values to memorize</li>
                <li><b><span class="high">Explain the tricky parts</span></b> via intuitive animations or easy-to-remember diagrams. You'll love it! <span style="color:#ccc">(cf. feedback:)</span></li>
                <li><b>Overview <span class="high">best practices and main pitfalls</span></b> from real world scenarios</li>
            </ul>

            <p>To meet the above criteria, I've personally created my training materials, through hundreds of hours of hard work to <span class="high">distil the most distinguished books</span> (plus other sources).</p>

            <p>Several key slides in my presentations can become the starting point of <span class="high">interactive digressions</span> about related concepts, in case the trainees want us to go there. And they usually do ;)</p>



            <h3>A lot of exercises</h3>
                <p>We will do exercises &gt; 50% of the time.</p>
                <p>You will get a <span class="high">preconfigured virtual machine</span>, that will allow you to <span class="high">solve the exercises</span> in class or back home, as well as to <span class="high">explore their solution</span>.</p>
                <p>A lot of questions and prize-contests will spice up the rest of the time of my modules.</p>

            <h3>Customized Agenda</h3>
            <p>Every group has its own interests or needs specific skills, so <span class="high">the course agenda is always personalized</span>. Perhaps you aren't sure what topics to choose. Please, let me help you with that. </p>
            <p>I always like to sit together with the trainees before the training and explore what you they really need/want. We could pick several modules from those listed here, customize them or add completely new ones.</p>
            <p>Most modules are designed to take around 2 hours, including demos, exercises or contests. In each day, 3 regular (2h) modules can be covered, plus a little extra practice or discussions. From my experience, trying to cover more than that usually just exhausts the participants with no additional benefit.</p>

            <h3>Industry-proven, Certified proficiency</h3>
            <p><span style="font-weight: bold" class="high">I won't bore you.</span> I will come with <span class="high">real-life examples and arguments</span>, not with some from-the-book blah-blah.</p>
            <p>I have <span class="high">9 years of industry experience with <b>all</b> the technologies I teach</span>. I've used them all to design, develop and deliver in production <span class="high">enterprise applications for demanding corporate clients</span> like world-leading flavors&amp;fragrances company, Belgium Post, or French BNPParibas Bank. Right from the beginning of my career, back in 2006, I was always the one who explored the boundary cases of the techonologies for each project, those places where what you wanted was not readily available out-of-the-box. In every case, I always strived to provide the simplest solution to each specific requirement, by following <span class="high">the phylosophy of each technology</span>.</p>
            <p>To be sure I covered all the corners of the Java EE specifications, I also obtained a <span class="high">long series of certifications</span>: Sun Certified Java Programmer (SCJP), Sun Certified Web Service Developer (.wsdl,JAX-WS), Oracle Certified JavaEE<sup>5</sup> Business Component Developer (EJB,JMS,JTA), Sun Certified Web Component Develiper (Servlet,JSP), Oracle Certified SQL Expert, and, the most interesting: <span style="font-weight:bold">Oracle Certified Java EE<sup>6</sup> Enterprise Architect</span></p>

            <h3>I'm looking for questions</h3>
            <p><span class="high">I am <b>always</b> expecting questions</span> any time during the trainings or breaks. The more questions I get from you, the more I manage to explain you. Honestly, there is no greater satisfaction for me but to answer your questions - it's only then that I'm sure I'm really helping you. The questions need not even be directly related to the topics we were talking about: I would be equally glad to be able to help you in any issues of your daily programmer life.</p>
            <p>I always say: for the sake of a classroom, <i>the "dumbest" question is the best question</i>. It makes everybody clarify their understanding, it rapidly involves everybody and opens up communication bridges. So- just ask!</p>
            <p>The best trainings happen when we manage to build <span class="high">a collaborative brainstorming-like athmosphere</span> in class. So, let's talk!</p>

            <p>From the very first training I delivered I started asking <span class="high">anonymous feedback</span>. The global results (from 297+ feedback forms) is summarized in the chart bellow. Upon request, I can show you the feedback forms (~2kg:), or per-module statistics, where available.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, as a sign of consideration, I will remain available remotely for the trainees for 1 week after the sessions for any questions or clarifications.</p>
            <p><span class="high">Valuable recommendations from senior developers</span> that attended my trainings are also <a href="#clients">available here</a>.</p>
            <p>Finally, the training contract will include a <span class="high">restitution clause in case of negative final feedback</span>. I'm really sure it's useless.</p>

            <p>This is the star-training of my portfolio. Delivered <span class="high">more than 10 times</span> in various formats and setups, I also held it for the last two years as <span class="high">part of the "Java" faculty course</span> of the Automatics & Computers Department of Politehnica University of Bucharest.</p>
            <p>This 2-part module will cover the most used Object-Oriented Design Patterns from the reference <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Gang-of-Four book</a>. Although the material covers all the GoF patterns, I would recommend instead to focus and analyze in more depth those patterns that are most used to day, and omit the grayed-out patterns in the agenda. This way we might gain enough time to talk about related concepts such as Aspect-Oriented-Programming, dynamic Java Proxies, and more.</p>
            <p>The presentation is very dynamic, with <span class="high">a lot of real-life examples</span> to help you deeply understand the concepts and remember them <i>forever</i>.</p>
            <p>The <span class="high">extensive application part</span> of this module however, is the one that will definetly shed light to all the quirks of the patterns. When your own hands will write the solutions to the exercises, you will have no choice but to fully understand the design patterns.</p>
            <p>The target audience includes any Object-Oriented programmers, on Java or .NET. </p>

                            <li>All the topics were interesting, but especially the Anti-Patterns!</li>
                            <li>To me, the entire course was important.</li>
                            <li>Every notion was important to me and helped me understand better what I have to do and how.</li>
                            <li>I personally liked how you managed to keep me alert. I wasn't bored for a second and I got a lot of necessary and important informations</li>

                            <li>I think it was especially interesting the live changes of the code together with their explanations</li>
                            <li>Taking into account that I haven't used design patterns until now, the examples helped me a lot</li>
                            <li>I consider very important the principles and concepts presented</li>
                            <li>The application of the described concepts was of great value!</li>

            <span class="duration">2 hours</span>
            <p>Developing Enterprise applications is hard. No one can argue that.</p>
            <p>But why? Is it because of their overly-complex business logic, their NFRs, the heterogenous teams, the business-IT gap, or maybe a combination of it all? Whatever the cause, <span class="high">enterprise applications tend to be very large</span>, with a considerable proportion of similar functionality. The perfect place for a pattern.</p>
            <p>Enterprise application strive for order. They simply can't stand a chaotic unorganized approach that will render their <span class="high">maintainance HELL</span> and eventually lead to the dreaded REWRITE.</p>
            <p>This module covers the major design patterns used in the development of typical enterprise Java applications. The patterns are studied on layers, paying special attention to the Client and the Business Layer, the places where the actual creativity usually resides. The participants will learn the <span class="high">principles of a good JavaEE design</span> and solutions to various recurrent problems.</p>
            <p>With one of the largest bibliography of all my modules, this course is based on <span class="high">a considerable part of the Oracle Certified JavaEE6 Architect agenda</span>. Even if the patterns are implemented using the Java EE5+ standard, most of these patterns can be used in any major middleware framework, like Spring.</p>
            <p>This module is probably the most difficuly one in my portfolio, so it is <span class="high">dedicated to those with certain experience</span> in JavaEE/Spring, but also to those who love challenges.</p>
            <p>Throughout the talk, we will stop on certain patterns to see how they look in code and to finalize certain incomplete implementations. However, the application part is rather scarce compared to my other modules due to the very abstract nature of the covered topics. </p>
            <p>NOTE: In case you want us to dissect a real-world example of an Java Enterprise application, I have such an example prepared that will take 1 more hour.</p>

            <span class="duration">2 parts x 2 hours (or shorter)</span>
            <p>The primary value of <span class="high">software is to be flexible</span>. The secondary value of software is to do what business wants it to do.</p>
            <p>Sounds insane? Just think a bit: what's the difference between IT and regular engineering? What propulsated IT that much? <span class="high">The ability to evolve, to adapt to new business needs</span>. And we all know how difficult it is to adapt and strech old, dirty, rigid code.</p>
            <p>Financially, the fact that 80% of the costs of a software project are in maintenance may not concern you, the developer, directly. But the fact that <span class="high">you read 10x times more time than you write</span> code should make it clear to you: do your very best to write clean, beautiful code that is easy to maintain. This module explains how do such art.</p>
            <p>Besides the bare act of writing code, the module also tackles the problematic of <span class="high">team work</span>, code responsibility and cooperation necessary to any professional software engineer.</p>
            <p>The module covers the most important practical aspects from the reference book <span class="high">'Clean Code' by Robert C. Martin</span>, along with many other sources. The training <span class="high">material was reviewed and discussed with numerous seniors</span> to reach a wider consensus regarding the ideas and their nuances.</p>
            <p>This is the module which is most likely to have <span class="high">the deepest impact on your day-to-day work</span>, changing the way you exercise your profession. That's why I allways recommend to add this module to any training.</p>

            <p>It's Black Friday, 6<sup>00</sup> AM. From the 1.000.000 users logged in on the emag.ro site, 1.000 submit their purchase each second. The online store application must resists such pressure while ensuring that all transactions are correctly processed. Furthermore, just realize that the online shopping system is not alone - it relies on quite a series of 3rd party services such as banks, courier services, suppliers and distributor chains, etc...</p>
            <p>Now, imagine building such a system from scratch, without any libraries in Java SE. By the way, did you thought about distributed transactions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">2PC</a>?</p>
            <p>I think you now begin to understand the problematic addressed by the EJB standard and the entire Java EE suite altogether. Now, obviously, besides the challenges of the infrastructural requirements, the business logic of this application is extremely difficult to manage by itself. So why not leave EJBs to handle most of these infrastructural requirements?</p>
            <p><span class="high">How does the EJB standard simplify the development of such demanding applications</span>? What services does Java EE<sup>5+</sup> offers us to overcome these callenges? How does it promote quality code?</p>

            <p>This intense module explains the core Java Concurrency principles, with special emphasis on the most useful topics in day-to-day practice: the monitor object, wait()/notify() primitives and the Thread Pool Executor. The hands-on lab that follows after the talk will test your understanding by solving several real-life applications of these concepts and classes. This module can be condensed to only 2 hours by diving into the details of only the most useful topics, or can be extended to 4 hours by including extended exercises (e.g. some technical interview questions related to concurrency - they are very-very nice!)</p>
            <p>To fully benefit of the module contents, one should review the core thread syncronization mechanisms: lock, semaphore, and if possible the Mutex concept. The course contents can become pretty challenging, <b>if</b> the trainees are interested in the topics.</p>
            <p>The trainees will write code themselves to practice these features.</p>

            <p>This advanced module gives general advice on how to write high-performance code in Java. The contents aims to be just a starting point for long discussions, as I will often ask the participants how would THEY implement a certain functionality already available in JVM (example: String.intern()). That's why this module is more of a brainstorm than a classic training, and highly motivated professionals would make it a very-very-very interesting session. The discussions may easily divagate to general algorithms and macro-design decisions. Any real problems the participants bring with them are MOST WELCOME: we will dissect them together in class, discuss tradeoffs and pitfalls.</p>

            <span class="duration">1 day</span>
            <p>You need to tune the performance of your Java applications? You don't understand the outcomes of the tunings you experimented? You want to learn how to write high-performance enterprise Java code? You want to know how to find a memory leak in a Heap Dump? Or you simply want to learn a lot about how your 'dear' JVM actually does its amazing(!!!) job?</p>
            <p>Whatever the case, you should already have a number of years of experience in Java and the terms like CPU register, heap, stack and thread should not be strange to you.</p>
            <p>This course is not intended to be a full reference of all the possible tuning options. Instead, the goal is for the trainees to fully understand the core concepts and principles underlying the performance of the JVM. Of course, the training explains in quite a detail the major tuning options, that 90% of the cases are enough to reach the performance goals. Multiple experiments will prove the effects of these tuning options in practice.</p>
            <p>The trainees will be able to practice JVM monitoring and tunings on their own machines.</p>

            <p>This introductive course covers the basic knowledge of WSDL-related technologies required in the day-to-day life of a Java developer. Most 'normal' usage patterns of WSDL are covered, along with some insights on how JAX-WS binds those technologies in Java. Of course, we could spend days talking about this topic, although the things we would cover will very rarely be used in real-life. However, if you need to take up a very complex set of web services or you really want to learn specific <i>niche</i> parts of these technologies like WS-Security-*, the course can be extended to with an additional module to cover those additional topics.</p>

        <!-- ****************** SPRING ******************** -->
        <section>
            <h2 id="training/spring" code="Spring" class="weight5">Spring Framework</h2>
            <span class="duration">5 parts x 2 hours</span>
            <p>Meet <span class="high">the framework which competes with a standard</span>. The debate will probably never end: Java EE vs Spring.</p>
            <p>Spring blossomed in the times of EJB 2.x, enabling a cleaner, extensible and more flexible approach vs an immature and badly designed EJB specification. Even if the Java EE standard greatly evolved, Spring remained a competing alternative to Servlets, EJBs and CDI beans.</p>
            <p>You may wonder: why?, how is this possible? What about vendor/version-lock-in? And you would be right. However, lots of architects choose to lock their applications to Spring instead of coding to the JavaEE standard alone.</p>
            <p>The major advantage of Spring is that <span class="high">you can do (pretty) almost you ever want to do</span> - you probably only need to configure some beans or at most extend some Spring helper classes. Whereas in JavaEE, as soon as you need something not available in the standard, you are lost - you would then probably need to lock yourself to the Application Server implementation (Managed beans, login modules, logging extensions, WAS SSL providers, etc).</p>
            <p>Apart from this flexibility that allows you to cover all those particular odd technical demands of your application, Spring also comes with several <span class="high">very-very nice helper classes</span> that help you reduce the boilerplate code in your application. JdbcTemplate and RestTemplate are the most renowed, effectively reducing the size of your DAO/ws client layer to a remarkable extent.</p>
            <p>Spring integrates perfectly with all the services of the JavaEE platform, and all the other major frameworks out there. Some say that <span class="high">if a java technology does not integrate with Spring, it's not mature enough</span>, and perhaps you should reconsider the alternatives :)</p>
            <p>The last part covers Spring Batch, a time-proven framework for building batch applications that manipulate large sets of data in a streaming-like fashion, with features like restartability, resume, jdbc batches, flat file parsing, etc. Although its complexity is remarkable, this part will target the more basic usages necessary for vanilla batch applications.</p>
            <p>The modules have a very pronounced applicative nature, with <span class="high">lots of exercises to fully understand the concepts</span>.</p>
            <p>For a <span class="high">full example of a real Spring enterprise application, an additional hour would be required</span> (not included in neither of the modules)</p>

            <p><span class="high">Meet the next level of software development.</span>
            </p>
            <p>What if instead of writing some tests after writing the actual development, you would begin developing a new feature by first writing a unit test for it. <i>The test will fail!</i>, you would say. <i>It's meaningless!!</i> </p>
            <p>Not at all!</p>
            <p>Because as soon as you'll see the test passing, that feature is secured from then on. If you do it correctly, <span class="high">you will get 100% real test coverage!</span>.</p>
            <p>And what does that mean? It means that <span class="high">you will not fear your own code anymore</span>. You will be able to <span class="high">refactor it as you like</span>, without the terror that you'll break some feature. And as soon as you will refactor it freely, <span class="high">the code will stay alive</span>, it will be able to follow the business requirements closely and cleanly.</p>
            <p>Besides the TDD phylosophy and implementation, this module also provides a remarkable series of <span class="high">guidelines for writing good unit tests</span>.</p>
            <p>Basic knowledge of unit testing and Java test mocking frameworks (EasyMock, jMock, Mockito,...) is recommended. The <a href="#training/junit">JUnit Testing module</a> can bridge that gap for you.</p>

            <p>Ok, so you have this huge project written with plain old JDBC code (<code>PreparedStatement ps =...</code>, <code>ResultSet rs =...</code>, <code>} finally {</code> and so on. You dream of <span class="high">migrating the data access layer to a newer, cleaner, more maintainable technology</span>. After a bit of research you realized JPA was to much for this jump. What option are you left with then? Spring's <code>JdbcTemplate</code>, you may say. Yes indeed.</p>
            <p>But couldn't you have more? Couldn't you get rid of the <code>rs.getLong(24)</code> call and have instead a <span class="high">declarative Java object - result set column mapping</span> ?</p>
            <p>What about those search queries with variable number of criteria, for which you concatenate SQL bits and hope to not mess up the order of the prepared statement's parameters? Couldn't you get rid of those <code>if (hasCriteriaX) { sql += " AND criteriaX = ?"; psArgs.add(criteriaX); }</code> code ? Wouldn't it be nice to <span class="high">compose dynamic queries in a more declarative way</span>?</p>
            <p>Meet MyBatis, the framework that you were looking for. This workshop covers all the features of the <a href="https://mybatis.github.io/mybatis-3/">MyBatis data mapper</a>, starting from the most trivial scenarios and diving into the more advanced topics as <span class="high">linked result maps, N+1 query problem and dynamic queries</span>. Special emphasis is placed on <span class="high">how to migrate legacy SQL queries to MyBatis</span>. The contents roughly follows the online tutorial.</p>
            <p>Some minimum Knowledge of SQL is recommended.</p>

            <span class="duration">2 hours</span>
            <p>XML is everywhere.</p>
            <p>But do you know <span class="high">how to define the structure of such an XML</span>? And then, <span class="high">how do you work with XMLs in Java</span>?</p>
            <p>The XML Schema Definition specification is remarkably complex, because it needs to be as flexible as possible. For regular enterprise applications however, only a (very) limited subset of all these features are used, for example: complex types, simple types, enumerated values, length/min/max restrictions, regex patterns, etc. This module covers all these common constructs, giving you more than 90% of all the XSD knowledge you will probably ever need.</p>
            <p>Ok, so you defined your XML structure (.xsd), what then? How do you read/write such XMLs? Do you struggle with SAX events or you cross your fingers and load the whole DOM in memory? Or maybe you are a litle fancier and you play with StAX? All of these standards have their use cases, but for regular enterprise applications, <span class="high">you would probably like to work with JAXB objects that closely resemble your Java Model</span> than with Nodes, Attributes or Events. Let's see how this JAXB works and perhaps how can we customize it a bit.</p>

            <p>When constructing a building, once you lay the foundation for a hospital, it's quite unlikely that you will end up building a Theme Park. In a software project however, nothing is impossible. An application should be able to evolve towars whatever the business wants it to, changing its architecture to fit their current needs. And this is possible only through regular feedback and true collaboration with the business, along with other techniques and principles. Meet the Agile Methodlogy.</p>
            <p>SCRUM is the most used methodology for Agile projects. It is a methodology encompassing the entire project lifecycle aimed to improve the flexibility and the 'agility' of the projects in order for them to handle partial, changing or late specification from the business. In such a dynamic business world, IT is the area which can best support changing requirements.</p>

            <p>I gained the majority of my training experience inside IBM, holding internal trainings to fellow employees. However, in mid 2015 I've began holding trainings independently to interested companies. Their references are available upon request.

            <p class="recommendation">Victor has an excellent mastery of the topics presented and managed to raise my expectations about how a technical course should look like, both regarding the content, as well as its presentation. <span class="high">A consistent professional experience helped him to formulate an authentic practical perspective</span> on the topics, something that was missing from many courses I participated to.
                <br />I believe that an important element in the success of his trainings is the personal and interactive aspect that he adds to the materials and to the presentation. This approach helped me remember a lot easier the discussed topics, and <span class="high">encourages a relaxed informal interaction</span> between the instructor and the audience.
                <br /> He is one of the few trainers that add a substantial value to the presented materials and I trustfully recommend his courses.

                <span class="recommendation-original" title="Victor are o stapanire excelenta a materiei prezentate si a reusit sa-mi ridice asteptarile despre cum ar trebui sa arate un curs tehnic, atat din punct de vedere al continului cat si al prezentarii. O substantiala experienta in domeniu l-a ajutat sa aduca o perspectiva autentica de practicalitate si aplicabilitate, care mi-a lipsit din multe alte cursuri la care am participat.
   Cred ca un element important in succesul cursurilor sale, este aspectul personal si interactiv pe care il adauga materialelor si prezentarii. Abordare sa m-a ajutat sa retin mul mai usor subiectele discutate, si incurajeaza o interactiune relaxata intre instructor si audienta.
Este unul dintre putinii instructori care aduc o valoare substantiala materialelor prezentate si recomand cu toata increderea cursurile sale.">(hover for original Romanian feedback)</span>

Interactive sessions, no questions without answers and very well organized presentations made us very involved in the course topics.

His lectures consisted of 2 talks of 3 hours that took place together with his colleague from IBM, Florin Diaconu. Overall, their lectures were <span class="high">extremely well regarded by the students attending the course</span> (all in all, a rather large audience as there are about 120 students enrolled in OOP course with about 50 students frequently attending the courses). In terms of his presentations, he has displayed charisma, was on top of any technical question my students asked him and it was really fun to organize the design patterns course with him.

                Victor is an extremely talented trainer (and software engineer as well) devoted to his job as a tutor: he plan the training well in advance taking into account the best practices in domain, he reviews the material before the training session to ensure it is adequate to the audience, he rehearse the presentation before and reviews it after the training session based on the students feedback ensuring that next sessions will be even better, close to perfection. Being also a passionate developer, he will bring a real and valuable experience which is often missing in many other trainings. I strongly recommend him!
